Tackling the obesity crisis with technology
Applicability of using QR codes for nutrition data
Type of application to build (Desktop app, Web app or Mobile app)
Updating food packaging nutrition information with technology
Nudging applicability
Potential to use a neural network to classify whether the food is good to eat?
Hard coding the ruleset using traditional programming practices or using NN?
DO you really need a NN to solve this problem? Can you not simply just use hard coded 	rules as it's not an incredibly difficult problem to solve
Creation of the different datasets (Training, benchmark and testing). Need to create 	probably quite a large set of data but before you can do this need to determine the 	criteria by which to judge the food.
Considerations need to be made with regard to proposed percentages of intake per meal. 	Refer to the nutrientinstitution paper for this.

NN input layer structure
[Calories]
[Fat]
[Of which saturates]
[Carbohydrates]
[Of which sugars]
[Fibre]
[Protein]
[Salt]
//Additional inputs for added complexity
[Gender]
[Age]
[Time of day]

NN output layer structure
[Green - Good to eat]
Single output node that presents confidence score in whether the food is good to eat.
The closer to 1, the better the confidence

Need to consider the normalisation of the input values to all fit a common pattern
Which type of activation function will work best? (Sigmoid, ReLU, tanh, softmax)
