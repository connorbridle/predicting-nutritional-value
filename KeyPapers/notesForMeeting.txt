Inclusion of other factors such as age, weight, gender in a controlled environment (ie one with made up individuals
	rather than an actual sample)
Then using a neural network to solve this problem. The original/base categories could probably be solved with some hard
	coded rules. Eg when sugar is above a certain point, classify RED. However with the introduction of more 
	categories to classify the decision of whether or not to eat a certain food, it becomes a more difficult
	problem.
